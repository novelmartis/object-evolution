# object-evolution
Codes to evolve grayscale objects

In order to be able to run the project install DEAP and Tensorflow libraries. The project was build using python 2.7. 

The art_deap.py contains the code for evolving grayscale object.

The graphics_deap.py file contains code that handles the drawing of the shapes.

The data used can be found in the stimuli folder.

The art_deap.py file needs to be excecuted in order for the evolution process to start.
